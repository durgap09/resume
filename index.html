              I'm an experienced IT professional with a
              strong background in systems administration and DevOps
              practices, culture, and tools.

                    I work closely with around a dozen software development
                    teams to provide and support a platform, infrastructure,
                    and workflows for USGS applications and supporting services.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    I help plan long-term IT strategy and the details of
                    execution; technology adoption; and help oversee the
                    deployment, integration, and ongoing management of projects
                    across several teams throughout the USGS.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    I've designed, managed, and executed on many projects in
                    their entirety, including the migration of several
                    application and services from on-premises deployments to AWS
                    and containers.
                    I've worked with hundreds of codebases spanning multiple
                    languages; developed, deployed, and supported hundreds of
                    applications and services; designed and supported hundreds
                    of build and deployment pipelines; implemented a
                    complete configuration management solution for servers in a
                    hybrid environment (AWS/VMware); implemented Docker as a
                    development tool and in the deployment of applications and
                    services; and written countless lines of detailed documentation.
                    </p><p>
                    I've reduced the complexities and barriers to
                    application deployments and enabled teams to be more autonomous.
                    I've held workshops for teams on technical topics
                    like Docker, DevOps, AWS, and Puppet. Through all this, I've
                    collaborated and coordinated across multiple product and
                    services teams throughout the US Geological Survey.

                    I traveled around the country providing consultation and
                    training to Puppet's customers on products and industry
                    methodologies. I earned a reputation as a hard worker who
                    was persistent in providing an excellent quality of work and
                    thoroughness on every engagement I had. I provided
                    consulting to a wide range of customers, from smaller scale

                    I've contributed to many Puppet modules and other tools both

                    integration into organizations' environments and workflows,
                    earning consistently high marks in customer satisfaction. I
                    advised on technical aspects of pre-sales and performed
                    'scoping' of consulting work. In addition to consulting, I
                    regularly instructed all of Puppet's training offerings at
